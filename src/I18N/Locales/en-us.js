      text: `Reading is a practice that brings numerous benefits to readers and when stimulated from childhood, the positive impacts can be much greater. Through it, children develop concentration, memory, reasoning and understanding, stimulate oral language and expand their creative capacity.      .
      The benefits extend to the strengthening of affective bonds, when the moment is shared, and to socio-emotional skills, since, through reading, children begin to understand their feelings and try to deal with them.`,

      text: `From a very early age I had a lot of contact with reading, and I believe it was an important part of my development. My mastery of the Portuguese language and its flourishes, as well as several learnings and references that I carry with me until today are based on this contact that I had so quickly in my life.
      From my point of view, reading is something that should always be instilled in young people, however, in the right way. I have always been very fond of fantasy and fiction books, however, the contact that the school gives us is not the most focused on this type of taste, and can even generate a belief in children that reading is something tedious. I remember to this day that I once had to read "A Menina que Descobriu o Brasil", and I couldn't get more than a paragraph into the book, while at the same time I managed to read "A Batalha Apocalipse" in a matter of days.`,

      text: `I spent a large part of my life reading comics, and I continue to do so today. This contact with reading not only provided me with different experiences, but also gave me a baggage of studying colors, shapes, and art as a whole, which I carry with me until today, and use both in my projects and in my personal life.`,

      title: "Fiction",
      text: `I have a tremendous appreciation for fiction, more specifically science. My immediate contact as a young man was with science fiction films, but my appreciation has evolved, and today I consume this category of media in different ways, and reading is not far from that. I believe that several projects that I carried out in the past had some inspiration in this field, due to the size of the impact that it caused me, and still causes.`,

      title: "Romances",
      text: `A lot of people take "Romance" too literally when it comes to books. Works like "Conan the Barbarian", "1984" and even the many works related to the beloved Sherlock Holmes can be considered novels. A novel is nothing more than a long text, which tells the story of one or more characters, and their various conflicts, so it turns out to be an umbrella term, which covers several literary works of extreme value.`,
